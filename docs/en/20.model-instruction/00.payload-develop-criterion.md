To ensure the safety of aircraft when carrying payload devices to perform flight tasks, please follow DJI's payload criterion when using PSDK to develop payload devices.

## Hardware Interface Standard

> **Notes**
>
> * **DO NOT** short the pins of the aircraft or the hardware platform.
> * **DO NOT** Connect the aircraft to a power output system or input current to the aircraft.
> * The load capacitance needs to be ≤500uF. If it exceeds this threshold, the aircraft will trigger short-circuit protection at the moment of power-on, and the SDK power supply will turn off the output.
> * The protective current is 4A. If the current exceeds, the aircraft will cut off the power to ensure the flight safety.
> * E-Port Lite only supports Matrice 3D/3TD and Flycart 30 models.
> * Mavic 3E/3T and M30/M30T models only provides an E-port to expand development and connect PSDK payload.
> * M300 RTK provides PSDK interfaces and OSDK Interface to expand development and connect PSDK payload. Accessories that can be used with PSDK interfaces are SkyPort V2 and X-Port.  Accessories that can be used wit(h OSDK Interface are SDK round ribbon cable and OSDK expansion module.
> * M300 RTK PSDK Interfaces includes one top-mounted gimbal port and two bottom-mounted gimbal ports. For details, please refer to [Device Connection](https://developer.dji.com/doc/payload-sdk-tutorial/en/quick-start/device-connect.html#payload-development-based-on-typec-interface-osdk-expansion-interface).

## Structural Design Standards

> **Notes:**
>
> * To prevent the payload device mounted on the aircraft from being affected by the flight inertia of the aircraft, hitting the battery compartment and blades, and damaging the aircraft or the payload device, please design the size of the payload device reasonably.
> * To prevent the payload device from affecting the moment of inertia of the aircraft, please minimize the size of the payload device.

The requirements of the payload which is mounted on the X-Port are as follows:    
* The width of the pitch on the X-Port is 80mm. The width of the payload couldn't exceed the wheelbase.     
* The weight of the payload must be lighter than 450g otherwise the payload may damage the gimbal or the pressure-reducing ball.     
* The centroid of the normal payload must be on the axis line of X-Port， and the payload couldn't strike the X-Port when the payload raised to 45°. The centroid of the payload must on the axis line when the payload’s zoom is in the maximum factor.   
* If the payload touches the ground， please use the Long Landing Gear.    
* Be sure that the port of the payload is completely flat, ensure that the waterproof could be sealed completely.      
* The shell of the payload could be aluminum alloy. A plastic or carbon case is not recommended.

## Video Stream Transmission Standard
                                       
Use PSDK to develop the Payload **must** select one of the two **H.264** standard.

**Custom-H264** standard

### Characteristic

1. Standard H264 standard stream is more common and easier to obtain.
2. When using this video stream format to send the code stream, it will be transparently transmitted to the App terminal through the aircraft for decoding, and the real-time code rate must not exceed the feedback value.
3. Use this format to transmit the video stream, and the SEI content can be transmitted to the App.

### Criterion

The **camera** payload device developed based on PSDK, when using the **Custom-H264 standard**, need to pay attention to the following key configuration information:

</table>

> **Note:** When using the H.264 encoding standard, the GOP encoding structure must use Period I (intra-frame encoded frames, one IDR frame will be inserted every 1 second to ensure that image data can be recovered if lost).

**DJI-H264** standard

### Characteristic

1. The more stringent DJI H264 standard stream standard.
2. When using this video stream format to send the code stream, it will be transcoded by the aircraft. Within the maximum code rate limit, the code rate can be dynamically adjusted according to the real-time image transmission link to achieve the best image transmission display effect.
3. When using this format to transmit the video stream, the SEI content will be discarded by the aircraft and cannot be transmitted to the App.

### Criterion

When using the **camera** payload device developed based on PSDK, when using the **DJI-H264 standard**, you need to pay attention to the following key configuration information:

> **Note:** 
>
> * When using H.264 encoding standard, Gop structure is optional, which is Period I or GDR.
> * If it is Period I, each I frame is required to be an IDR frame. If it does not meet the requirements, there is no guarantee that the image transmission can be recovered from the packet loss error; Send After finishing SPS/PPS, immediately transmit the stream of frame I, and then transmit AUD. There is no AUD information between SPS/PPS and slice. In the Period Ⅰ structure, it is recommended to have an IDR per second.
> * If it is GDR, sps/pps need to be transmitted in each GDR refresh frame.

> **Compatibility Note:** If the video stream format is set to **DJI H264** format, [data transmission function](https://developer.dji.com/doc/payload-sdk-tutorial/en/function-set/basic-function/data-transmission.html) will not be available, it is recommended to switch to [SDK interconnection function](https://developer.dji.com/doc/payload-sdk-tutorial/en/function-set/advanced-function/sdk-interconnection.html) use.
