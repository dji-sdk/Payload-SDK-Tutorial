## Overview
Local upgrade is a function for upgrading the firmware of the payload device. Developers can use the local update function to facilitate users to select the local firmware file through DJI Assistant 2 to update the firmware of the payload device.

## Firmware transfer protocol
When developing the local upgrade function, you can call the interface `DjiUpgrade_Init` to specify the transmission protocol and configure the transmission setting information.

#### Using FTP protocol
PSDK supports developers to use FTP protocol to transfer firmware to be upgraded. When developers use FTP protocol to transfer firmware, they need to deploy the corresponding FTP server for the load device. For details, please refer to <a href="#1">Deploying FTP Server</a>.

> **Note:** 
> * Only load devices developed based on the Linux platform support the developer to use the FTP protocol to transfer the firmware to be upgraded through the network port.
> * When using the FTP protocol to transfer the payload device firmware, the user account is: `psdk_payload_ftp` The password is: `DJi_#$31`

#### Using DCFTP protocol
DCFTP, DJI Common File Transfer Protocol, is DJI's unique file transfer protocol. Developers can obtain the required files by calling the specified interface.
When using the DCFTP protocol to upgrade the firmware of the payload device, please refer to `T_DjiUpgradeDcftpFileTransferOpt` to learn how to obtain the firmware, and initialize the structure when calling the `DjiUpgrade_Init()` interface.

> **Note:** 
> * This method can be used to transfer firmware using RTOS or load device without network port.
> * Since this method uses the command signal transmission channel to transmit firmware, the transmission speed is slower.

## <p id=1>Deploy FTP server</p>
To facilitate developers use the FTP protocol to transfer the firmware required for the payload device, please follow the steps below to deploy the FTP server using vsftpd.
#### 1. Install FTP server

1. Download [vsftpd](https://terra-1-g.djicdn.com/fee90c2e03e04e8da67ea6f56365fc76/SDK%20%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3/PSDK/vsftpd-3.0.3.tar.gz).
2. Install the vsftpd server installation package:
> **Instructions:** For the complete installation method, please refer to the INSTALL file in the directory to install vsftpd.

* Use `tar -zxvf vsftpd-*.*.*.tar.gz` command to extract the installation package
* Go to `cd vsftpd-*.*.*/` directory
* Install the FTP server in the following order:
```c
make
su
cp vsftpd /usr/local/sbin/vsftpd
cp vsftpd.conf.5 /usr/local/man/man5
cp vsftpd.8 /usr/local/man/man8
cp vsftpd.conf /etc
```
3. Create the secure_chroot_dir directory: `mkdir /usr/share/empty`

#### 2. Configure FTP server
1. Modify the configuration items:
* In `/etc/vsftpd.conf` file, change anonymous_enable to NO
```c
anonymous_enable=NO
```
* Set the following configuration items:
```c
local_enable=YES
write_enable=YES
```

2. Add users
* Using the `adduser` command, specify the user directory with `--home`
* Use `userdel -r` command to delete users
* Add user permission to upgrade payload device firmware: `adduser psdk_payload_ftp --home /upgrade`
* Enter the password according to the prompt: DJi_#$31

#### 3. Run the FTP server
1. Run the FTP server using `sudo /usr/local/sbin/vsftpd &` command
2. Configure startup items: add `/usr/local/sbin/vsftpd &` to `/etc/rc.local`
3. Use the command `ps aux | grep vsftpd` to check the running status of the FTP service

## Implement local upgrade function

#### 1. Local upgrade module initialization
Before using the local upgrade function, please initialize the upgrade module and specify the transmission protocol used to upgrade the firmware.

```c
returnCode = DjiUpgrade_Init(&upgradeConfig);
if (returnCode != DJI_ERROR_SYSTEM_MODULE_CODE_SUCCESS) {
USER_LOG_ERROR("DjiUpgrade_Init error, return code = %d", returnCode);
return returnCode;
}
```
#### 2. Enable local upgrade function
Before using the local upgrade function, users need to enable the local upgrade function. After enabling the local upgrade function, DJI Assistant 2 will display the upgrade interface of the load device, and the user can select the desired firmware file to upgrade the load device.
```c
returnCode = DjiUpgrade_EnableLocalUpgrade();
if (returnCode != DJI_ERROR_SYSTEM_MODULE_CODE_SUCCESS) {
USER_LOG_ERROR("DjiUpgrade_EnableLocalUpgrade error, return code = %d", returnCode);
return returnCode;
}
```
#### 3. Upgrade process
The developer implements the function of local upgrade of the load device according to the structure `T_DjiUpgradeHandler`, and registers the callback function of the local upgrade of the load device through the `DjiUpgrade_RegHandler()` interface; pushes the upgrade state of the load device through the function `DjiUpgrade_PushUpgradeState()`.

## Use local upgrade function
#### Run the program with the upgrade function
Please refer to [Run the sample](https://developer.dji.com/doc/payload-sdk-tutorial/en/quick-start/run-sample-code.html) when using the "local upgrade" function, and compile the program that currently supports the local upgrade function.

###### Linux platform operating environment adjustment
In order to use the upgrade function, you need to set the program to start by default, please refer to the following steps:
1. Copy the compiled application to the `/usr/local/bin/` directory;
2. Add the following configuration items in `/etc/rc.local`:
* `chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0`
* `chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/dji_sdk_demo_linux`
* `/usr/local/bin/dji_sdk_demo_linux&`
> **Note:** ttyUSB0 is the serial port device connected to the load device, the developer can modify the name according to the actual situation
3. Restart the load device and check whether the program is running normally through the terminal command `ps aux | grep dji_sdk_demo_linux`

###### STM32F4 platform operating environment adjustment
To use the local upgrade function on the STM32F4 platform, the developer needs to [burn the Bootloader into the development platform](https://developer.dji.com/doc/payload-sdk-tutorial/en/quick-start/config-develop-environment.html), and then burn the firmware of the load device. The `STM32F4Platform` in the following directory can be `psdk_development_board_1.0` (use the load device development board) or `stm32f4_eval` (use the STM32 development board).

1. Burn the Bootloader into the microcontroller, and the Bootloader project directory is:
* samples/sample_c/platform/rtos_freertos/stm32f4_discovery/project/mdk_bootloader
2. Burn the application firmware into the microcontroller. The application firmware directory is:
* samples/sample_c/platform/rtos_freertos/stm32f4_discovery/project/mdk

> **Note:** 
> * Bootloader is a program that runs when the MCU is powered on to update the application firmware and execute the application firmware.
> * Application firmware: realize the software function of the load device, compile the Payload SDK Lib.

#### Compile the firmware
1. Modify the firmware version number
Modify the version number of the firmware in the `T_DjiTestUpgradeConfig` structure definition.
> **Note:** When modifying the version number, the version number must not be lower than the current version, that is, when the current firmware version number used by the load device is V02.01.00.03, please change the version number to V02.01.00.04, as follows example shown.

```c
T_DjiTestUpgradeConfig testUpgradeConfig = {
.firmwareVersion = {1, 0, 0, 0},
.transferType = DJI_FIRMWARE_TRANSFER_TYPE_DCFTP,
.needReplaceProgramBeforeReboot = true
};
```
2. Compile the file
Compile the firmware files required for the upgrade of the load device:
* STM32: The firmware of the load device is the `dji_sdk_demo_linux.bin` file in the STM32F4 project directory
* Linux: The firmware of the load device is the compiled `dji_sdk_demo_linux` program file

3. Modify the firmware file name
After recompiling the firmware file, you need to modify the name of the compiled firmware, such as `PSDK_APPALIAS_V02.01.00.04.bin`.
File name format: `Product Name_Vaa.bb.cc.dd.bin`
* Product Name: load product name (if the developer has set a load alias, the name will be the load alias)
* Vaa.bb.cc.dd: four-digit version number for the payload

> **Note:** The version number in the firmware file name must be consistent with the version number defined in the code, otherwise the load device may fail to upgrade.

#### Using DJI Assistant 2 to upgrade the firmware
Open DJI Assistant 2 and select the compiled firmware upgrade file (PSDK_APPALIAS_V02.01.00.04.bin) to upgrade the firmware.

## Sample upgrade principle introduction
#### Linux program file upgrade principle
Using the upgrade function, you can obtain the firmware file that needs to be updated (through FTP or DCFTP protocol), replace the firmware file with the original running program file, and complete the firmware upgrade after the system restarts.

> * Use local upgrade function: `platform/linux/manifold2/application/main.c`
> * Upgrade firmware for payloads developed on Linux platforms: `platform/linux/common/upgrade_platform_opt`

#### STM32F4 microcontroller program upgrade principle
The load device developed by STM32F4 directly reads the firmware file from the Flash and runs the load device program, so the developer needs to burn the Bootloader first and then the application firmware. For the steps of burning the Bootloader, please refer to [Run the sample](https://developer.dji.com/doc/payload-sdk-tutorial/en/quick-start/run-sample-code.html).

##### STM32F4 firmware upgrade process
1. After the STM32F4 platform is powered on, it will start the MCU
2. Run Bootloader and judge the upgrade status:
* If there is no need to upgrade the firmware, the Bootloader will jump to the application firmware area and run the application firmware
* If you need to upgrade the firmware of the load device, the Bootloader will jump to the application firmware area after replacing the firmware file, and run the application firmware

> * Initialize the upgrade function: `platform/rtos_freertos/stm32f4_discovery/application/application.c`

> **Note:** `stm32f4_discovery` in the above directory can be either `psdk_development_board_1.0` or `stm32f4_eval`.

##### Modify Flash address space (optional)
1. Modify the address definition:
Modify the address definition in the `platform/rtos_freertos/STM32F4Platform/drivers/BSP/flash_if.h` file
```c
/* End of the Flash address */
#define FLASH_END_ADDRESS 0x080FFFFF

/* Define the address from where user application will be loaded.
NOTE the 1st sector 0x08000000-0x08007FFF is reserved for the IAP code */
#define APPLICATION_ADDRESS ADDR_FLASH_SECTOR_4
#define APPLICATION_ADDRESS_END (ADDR_FLASH_SECTOR_8 - 1)

/* Define the user application size */
#define APPLICATION_FLASH_SIZE (APPLICATION_ADDRESS_END - APPLICATION_ADDRESS + 1)

/* Define the address from where user application will be stored in upgrade mode */
#define APPLICATION_STORE_ADDRESS ADDR_FLASH_SECTOR_8
#define APPLICATION_STORE_ADDRESS_END (FLASH_END_ADDRESS)

/* Define the address for param store */
#define APPLICATION_PARAM_STORE_ADDRESS ADDR_FLASH_SECTOR_2
#define APPLICATION_PARAM_STORE_ADDRESS_END (ADDR_FLASH_SECTOR_4 - 1)
```

Address assignment statement:
* bootloader: 0x08000000～0x08007FFF
* Parameter Store Area: 0x08008000～0x0800FFFF
* Application Firmware: 0x08010000～0x0807FFFF
* Upgrade Firmware Store Area: 0x08080000～0x080FFFFF


2. Configure the interrupt vector
In the `platform/rtos_freertos/STM32F4Platform/drivers/CMSIS/Device/Source/system_stm32f4xx.c` file, fill in the offset address of the application firmware

```c
/*!< Uncomment the following line if you need to relocate your vector Table in
Internal SRAM. */
/* #define VECT_TAB_SRAM */
#ifdef USE_BOOTLOADER
//attention : this value is equal ( application address - 0x08000000 )
#define VECT_TAB_OFFSET 0x10000
#else
#define VECT_TAB_OFFSET 0x00
#endif
```

3. Modify the project configuration information
Modify the project configuration information in Bootloader and application firmware, and fill in the correct Flash address.
* Bootloader project directory: `platform/rtos_freertos/stm32f4_discovery/project/mdk_bootloader`
* Application firmware project directory: `platform/rtos_freertos/stm32f4_discovery/project/mdk`
