<div style="text-align: center"><p>Figure. Connect Development Board to E-Port</p></div>
</div>

1. Connect the aircraft's E-Port interface to the female end of the E-Port coaxial cable, ensuring correct pin alignment.
2. Connect the male end of the coaxial cable to the E-Port connector with side A facing the bottom of the E-Port adapter board (foam side) and side B facing the front of the E-Port (component side).

  > **Note:** The E-Port coaxial USB-C cable doesn't have a foolproof design, allowing A/B side to be reversibly connected. Due to pin layout differences in the aircraft's USB-C, if the coaxial cable is reversed, the other end also needs to be flipped correspondingly. **If not flipped correspondingly, the E-Port Development Kit can not power up and communicate.**

3. Switch the USB device/host mode to "Host".
4. If powering through the E-Port Development Kit, ensure check the voltage values for each port to prevent damaging the payload device.
5. Connect to the payload device's serial port.
6. Connect the payload device USB device/USB OTG/network port to the USB 2.0 interface.

  > **Note:** When connecting to the payload device's network port, developers can use a USB to network adapter cable and ethernet cable to connect to the USB 2.0 interface.

7. Turn the E-Port dip switch to "ON".

### Connect Device to E-Port Lite Interface

Connect the aircraft directly to a computer using a USB-C cable to perform tuning tasks, or connect directly to a UART payload device with the USB-C OTG Adapter Cable and the USB to TTL serial module for simple command data transmission.

### Using OSDK Extension Module

The OSDK extension module is about to stop production, and it is recommended to use the E-Port development kit. If you want to learn about OSDK extension module, you can go to [OSDK Extension Module](https://developer.dji.com/doc/payload-sdk-tutorial/en/quick-start/drone-port.html) of Standard Hardware Port.

## Hardware Reference Design

[Hardware Reference Design](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Payload-SDK/blob/master/doc/reference_designs/E-Port%20Schematic%20Reference.pdf)

The above hardware connection is mainly based on DJI's development accessories to build a development environment, facilitating developers to quickly build a hardware environment and start PSDK software development. Usually, when the device is developed, it can be directly integrated into the device hardware environment based on the hardware pins on the aircraft, without the need for DJI expansion accessories, such as OSDK expansion adapter boards, E-PORT kits, etc.

Convenient for developers to integrate hardware connections based on OSDK/PSDK type C ports. DJI provides reference schematics for M300 OSDK type C ports, M350 E-PORT type C ports, and M30/M3 industry version PSDK type C ports. Developers can refer to and combine their own hardware device designs.
