## E-Port Lite

The Matrice 3D/3TD and FlyCart 30 models provide an E-Port Lite interface, which serves as the aircraft's USB-C calibration port. This interface's dimensions and pin definitions align with the USB Type-C standard.

The interface supports the USB 2.0 to Serial Communication Protocols and supports some of the PSDK V3 software features. For a detailed list of features please refer to the *Aircraft Type Function Difference* in [Development Platform](https://developer.dji.com/doc/payload-sdk-tutorial/en/model-instruction/choose-develop-platform.html).

With a USB-OTG cable and a USB-to-serial module, it can be connected to the MCU platform for PSDK development and debugging, which supports payload applications and improves work efficiency.

> * Rated power is 460 W (51.2 V), with a peak power of 1024 W (51.2 V). Exceeding this power can jeopardize flight safety, and may cause loss of aircraft control or even an crash.<br/>
> * High voltage is not the default output. To enable high voltage output, use the [`ApplyHighPowerSync`](https://developer.dji.com/doc/payload-sdk-api-reference/en/module/power-management.html) interface in the PSDK power management feature. After applying through this interface, high power voltage can be output normally.
> * The actual working voltage range is 42 V - 60 V, and devices must be compatible with this entire range.<br/>
> * Rated current should be less than 9 A, with a peak current not exceeding 20 A. It's advised to avoid load current frequencies between 10 KHz - 1 MHz as high current peaks can impact aircraft sensor performance.<br/>
> * Ensure the current does not exceed 10 A within 3 seconds of aircraft startup and 80 A within 10 seconds of startup.<br/>
> * Devices must incorporate a soft-start circuit in the input bus. Exceeding standard power at aircraft startup triggers the aircraft load control board's over-current protection, causing the aircraft to shut off its power.<br/>
> * Do not short-circuit the pins of aircraft or hardware platforms. Do not connect aircraft to a power output system or input current into the aircraft.

> **Notes:**
> 
> * There are differences between different models in power supply interface, USB_VBUS interface, and USB_ID interface. Compatibility needs to be considered in software and hardware design.
> * NC pins are reserved signal pins of the aircraft side. To avoid the damage of the aircraft SDK interface during development and use, please leave the NC pins unconnected and do not connect to the custom pins of the device side.
> * For Mavic 3E/3T aircraft models, when it is in a powered-off state and connected to a PSDK payload, the PSDK payload and aircraft will be powered on simultaneously. The E-Port will supply power normally. When the aircraft is already powered on and the PSDK payload is hot swapped or connected the PSDK payload to the aircraft, the power supply of E-Port will be automatically cut off if the PSDK program fail to start within 15s.


* Power Output:
    * If you need to power the payload device, please use the VCC pin.

    > **Notes:** 
    >
    > * The rated voltage of M350 RTK VCC pin is 24 V. The current is limited to 4A. The total power output is 96W.
    > * The rated voltage of Matrice 30/30T VCC pin is 19.2-26.1 V. The current is limited to 4A. The total power output is from 76.8W to 104.4W.
    > * The rated voltage of Mavic 3E/3T VCC pin is 12-17.6 V. The current is limited to 3A. The total power output is 36-52.8W.
    > * Those VCC pins are under one network. Developers could connect the VCC pins according to actual requirements. But to ensure the aircraft output the current continuously and steadily, please connect 4 VCC pins at the same time.

  * M350 RTK、Matrice 30/30T、Mavic 3E/3T are the USB Host device by default. The USB_ID pin (A6) must be pulled down.

  * Only when the USB_ID pin (A6) is pulled down, then the USB_VBUS pin (A7) will output 5V voltage. Maximum current is 500mA. The USB_VBUS pins (A7) of M350 RTK and Mavic 3E/3T have no voltage output ability. They can only detect the presence or absence of external voltage.

  * ON_DET pin (A8) is the PSDK payload device detection pin of M350 RTK、Matrice 30/30T、Mavic 3E/3T. For rated voltage output, the opposite connected to the ON_DET pin (A8) **must be GND**, and do not connect any resistance in series.

* Data Communication:

  * If you want to use the USB 2.0 (usb bulk transfer) function or the Rndis (TCP/IP over USB) function, please use the USB_DP pin (B6) and USB_DM pin (B7).
  * For using the serial port on the aircraft to communicate with the payload device, please use the UART_RX pin (B8) and UART_TX pin (B5). UART_RX pin (B8) should connect with the TX side of the PSDK device and UART_TX pin (B5) should connect with the RX side of the PSDK device.

  > **Notes:** 
  >
  > * The baud rates of serial port supported by M350 RTK **E-Port** are 115200, 230400, 460800, 921600 and 1000000.

#### Install the Payload

1. Install the spindle arm: Use four M2 × 12 screws to lock the payload, and the depth of the corresponding threaded hole on the payload is not less than 5.3 mm.
2. Install the auxiliary shaft arm: Use an M3 screw, auxiliary shaft sleeve, and auxiliary shaft rubber plug to lock the auxiliary shaft arm. Make sure the M3 screw passes through the center axis of the pitch axis.
3. The centroid of the payload
    * For a payload with a constant centroid, the payload must be on the vertical line of the pitch axis.
    * For a zoom camera with a variable center of the centroid, the payload must be on the vertical line of the pitch axis when the lens is at the maximum magnification.

> **Notes:**
> 
> * There are differences between different models in power supply interface, USB_VBUS interface, and USB_ID interface. Compatibility needs to be considered in software and hardware design.
> * NC pins are reserved signal pins of the aircraft side. To avoid the damage of the aircraft SDK interface during development and use, please leave the NC pins unconnected and do not connect to the custom pins of the device side.


* Power Output:
    * If you need to power the user load equipment, please use the VCC_24V pin.
       > **Note:** 
       > * The rated voltage of this interface is 24V, and the total power output by the aircraft is 96w.
       > * Those VCC_24V pins are on the same network, developers could connect the VCC_24V pins according to actual requirements. But to ensure the aircraft output the current continuously and steadily, please connect 4 VCC_24V pins at the same time.

    * M300 RTK is in USB accessory mode, USB_ID pin (A6) **must be** floated.
    * If USB_VBUS pin (A7) is connected to the VBUS pin of the user's OSDK device, TVS devices should be connected for ESD protection. The voltage of this pin **should not exceed 5V**.
    * ON_DET pin (A8) is a detect pin of M300 external OSDK device. For 24V voltage output, the opposite connected to the ON_DET pin (A8) **must be GND**, and do not connect any resistance in series.

* Data Communication:
    * If you want to use the USB 2.0 function, please use the USB_DP pin (B6) and USB_DM pin (B7).
    * To use the serial port on the aircraft to communicate with the user payload device, please use the UART_RX pin (B8) and UART_TX pin (B5). UART_RX pin (B8) should connect with the TX side of the OSDK device and UART_TX pin (B5) should connect with the RX side of the OSDK device.

  > **Note:** The baud rates of serial port supported by M300 RTK OSDK Port are 115200, 230400, 460800, 921600 and 1000000.

* Time Synchronization: If you need to use the synchronization signal output by the aircraft, please use the SYNC_PPS pin (A5).
