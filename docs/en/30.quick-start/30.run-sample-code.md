After registering a PSDK enterprise account, please download the sample code provided by PSDK and supplement the application information in the sample code, and obtain the sample program by compiling, debugging, and burning. After binding DJI's hardware platform on DJI Assistant 2, you can run the sample program to learn how to use PSDK to develop a load device with the help of the sample program.

> **Note:** To run RTOS or Linux sample code on other development boards or operating systems, please refer to [Cross-platform porting](https://developer.dji.com/doc/payload-sdk-tutorial/en/quick-start/porting.html).

## Get Sample Code
After <a href="https://developer.dji.com/payload-sdk/apply/" target="_blank">register</a> as a DJI PSDK enterprise user, you can download the DJI PSDK development kit. Get the sample code provided by DJI in the PSDK development kit, learn how to use the PSDK to develop a payload device with the help of the sample code, and use the sample code to quickly develop a fully functional payload device.

## Create Payload Application
After obtaining the [permission](https://developer.dji.com/payload-sdk/apply) to develop payload products using PSDK, please go to the [User Center](https://developer.dji.com/user/apps/#all) to create a payload application and obtain the application ID and application key, as shown in Figure 1.

## Run RTOS Sample Code

> **Note:** This article takes the **STM32F4 Discovery development board** as an example to introduce the steps and methods of running the RTOS sample code.

### Burn Bootloader
1. Use Keil MDK IDE to open the project file `mdk_bootloader.uvprojx` located in the `sample/sample_c/platform/rtos_freertos/stm32f4_discovery/project/mdk_bootloader/`.
2. Use Keil MDK IDE to compile the project as a sample program.
3. **burn** the compiled sample program into the load device (such as the STM32F4_discovery development board).

> **Related Reference:**
>
> * Implement Bootloader: `platform/rtos_freertos/stm32f4_discovery/bootloader`
> * Project directory of Bootloader: `platform/rtos_freertos/stm32f4_discovery/project/mdk_bootloader`

### Fill Application Information
1. Use Keil IDE to open the project file `mdk_app.uvprojx` located in the `sample/sample_c/platform/rtos_freertos/stm32f4_discovery/project/mdk/`.
2. Fill in the `sample/sample_c/platform/rtos_freertos/application/dji_sdk_app_info.h` file with the name, ID, Key, License, developer account, and specified baud rate of the application.


```
#define USER_APP_NAME               "your_app_name"
#define USER_APP_ID                 "your_app_id"
#define USER_APP_KEY                "your_app_key"
#define USER_APP_LICENSE            "your_app_license"
#define USER_DEVELOPER_ACCOUNT      "your_developer_account"
#define USER_BAUD_RATE              "460800"
```

### Compile and Burn
* Use Keil MDK IDE to compile the sample code as a sample program.
* After compiling the sample code, **burn** the compiled program into the load device (such as the STM32F4_discovery development board).
* To debug the sample program, please set the baud rate of the serial debugging tool to: `921600`.

## Run the Linux Sample Code
> **Note:** This article takes **Manifold 2-C as an example to introduce the steps and methods of running the Linux sample code.

### Fill Application Information

* Replace the application name, ID, Key, License, developer account and specified baud rate in the `samples/sample_c/platform/linux/manifold2/application/dji_sdk_app_info.h` file.

```
#define USER_APP_NAME               "your_app_name"
#define USER_APP_ID                 "your_app_id"
#define USER_APP_KEY                "your_app_key"
#define USER_APP_LICENSE            "your_app_license"
#define USER_DEVELOPER_ACCOUNT      "your_developer_account"
#define USER_BAUD_RATE              "460800"
```

* Fill in the corresponding serial port names in the `LINUX_UART_DEV1` and `LINUX_UART_DEV2` macros in the `samples/sample_c/platform/linux/manifold2/hal/hal_uart.h` file.

```
#define LINUX_UART_DEV1    "/dev/your_com"
#define LINUX_UART_DEV2    "/dev/your_com"
```
* Use the `ifconfig` command to view the name of the network port device currently communicating with the drone, and fill in the `LINUX_NETWORK_DEV` macro in the `samples/sample_c/platform/linux/manifold2/hal/hal_network.h` file.

```
#define LINUX_NETWORK_DEV    "your_network_name"
```
### Compile the Sample Program

* **Compile the Sample Code**

Enter the root directory of the sample code project: `Payload-SDK/`, and use the following commands to compile the sample code into a sample program.
  1. `mkdir build`
  2. `cd build`
  3. `cmake ..`
  4. `make`

  Explanation of the root directory location:
```
Payload-SDK/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── EULA.txt
├── LICENSE.txt
├── README.md
├── build/
├── doc/
├── psdk_lib/
├── samples/
└── tools/
```

* **Execute C language sample program**
  * Go to the directory of the sample program: `cd build/bin/`
  * Use the `sudo ./dji_sdk_demo_linux` command to run the sample program
* **Execute the C++ language sample program**
  * Go to the directory of the sample program: `cd build/bin/`
  * Use the `sudo ./dji_sdk_demo_linux_cxx` command to run the sample program

## Application Binding (Using X-Port or SkyPort V2)

After binding the SkyPort V2 with the sample program through DJI Assistant 2, when the payload device is mounted on the drone, the payload device will automatically run the sample program compiled or burned by the developer.

> **Notes:** 
>
> * When using DJI Assistant 2 to bind or debug the payload device, please turn on the **"Data Authorization"** switch in the "Configuration" tab in the upper right corner of the software, otherwise DJI Assistant 2 will not be able to bind or debug the payload device normally.
> * After the initial binding of SkyPort V2, when using the same SkyPort V2 on different drones, there is no need to re-bind the sample program.

1. Mount the payload device (such as Manifold 2-C) or development board (such as STM32F407IGH6-EVAL) on the DJI drone, and connect the DJI drone to the computer at the same time.
2. Log in to DJI Assistant 2 using the **account** in **App Information**, and click the "Payload SDK" tab to enter the PSDK hardware platform interface.
3. On the PSDK hardware platform interface, click the "Bind" button to bind the hardware platform, sample program, and DJI drone.
4. After the binding is successful, the binding status in the PSDK hardware platform interface will be displayed as `bound`, as shown in Figure 2. Application binding.

" width="600" style="vertical-align:middle" alt/></span></p>
</div></div>


5. Confirm that the baud rate of the communication between the PSDK adapter and the PSDK payload is 460800 (the communication baud rate of the PSDK sample program is 460800);

</div></div>


6. After the application is bound successfully, the payload device will automatically run the sample program.
