## PSDK Introduction
In order to support developers in developing payload devices that can be mounted on DJI drones, DJI provides a development kit Payload SDK (PSDK) and development accessories [X-Port](https://store.dji.com/product/dji-x-port), [SkyPort V2](https://store.dji.com/product/psdk-development-kit-v2) and [SDK Round Ribbon Cable](https://store.dji.com/sg/product/osdk-round-ribbon-cable-set), etc. It is convenient for developers to develop payload that can be mounted on DJI drones by using the resources such as power supply, communication link and status information on DJI drones. According to the application requirements of the industry, based on the functional interface provided by PSDK, combined with specific structural design, hardware design, software logic implementation, and algorithm optimization, developers can develop such as **Automatic Inspection System**, **Infrared Camera**, **mapping camera**, **multispectral camera**, **megaphone**, **searchlight** and other load equipment to meet different subdivisions.

## Advantages

* ****Perfect Function****<br/>
  Using basic functions such as information acquisition, data transmission, and power management and advanced functions such as cameras, gimbals, payload coordination, and precise positioning, developers could design a perfect function payload. And PSDK provides a wealth of interfaces, which is convenient for developers to use third-party applications and algorithm frameworks to develop professional application software using technologies such as image recognition, automatic cruise and SLAM. In addition, it is also convenient for developers to access third-party sensors and cameras or testing equipment to collect the required data information to meet the user's personalized application functions and control needs.

* ****Customized and Scalable****<br/>
  Besides the DJI Pilot is compatible with payload which developed using PSDK, DJI provides Mobile SDK to help developers to develop **Mobile Apps** to control the payload; provides Onboard SDK to support developers write the self-control programs; Windows SDK can help the developer to develop the Data analyzing software.

* **Compatible with a wide range of software and hardware platforms**<br/>
  Applications developed using PSDK can run on mainstream embedded hardware platforms, such as STM32, etc., and can also run on mainstream embedded operating systems and software architectures, such as Linux and RTOS. After performing the required work based on [Porting](https://developer.dji.com/doc/payload-sdk-tutorial/en/quick-start/porting.html), you can run PSDK-based application on different versions of software and hardware platforms.

* ****Support Services****<br/>
  PSDK not only provides the API and hardware for developing the payload, but also provides standards, technical support, marketing, and ecological cooperation services, etc.
